description: after seeing Spider Man...(not a spoiler)

It’s not a spoiler, after seeing *Spider Man - Far From Home*,I feel like strongly writing something down.

It’s an another Marvel’s movie. And everything is following *Avengers - End Game* , the most epic movie I’v ever seen.  As usual, it’s all about a hero fight  the evil, and finally win. But to me, they are always an inspiration.

## It’s all about **grown up**
We can still remember how Spider Man spoiled things, and Iron Man showed up and saved the day, how Tony lectured Peter to be brave and responsible. 

Like a line in Spider Man,

> *With great power, comes great responsibility.*  

However, Peter is still a high school teenager, not like Captain America, Thor, who are born a fighter. He tries for living a normal life, like everyone around him, and chasing his love. That’s the most contradictory topic in this movie. 

Even if a powerful person called him, he still put his “little plan” on a top priority without slightest hesitation. That’s simply how a young guy behaves.

I like the delicate scenes when Peter behaved panic when MJ suddenly turned to him, and became jealous when MJ talked to the other guy. These scenes were so real to me that my mind just went back to the past unconsciously. 

Castles, fireworks, carnivals, friends, the trip escaped from the stressful real life, and of course, memories.

Troubles always come coincidentally. You have to choose whether to deal with them, or avoid them. And heroes always see the big picture.  They know if they can’t take care of these troubles, they just bring them to everyone around them. They simply have no choice.  When they realized this and took actions, they have already grown up.

Peter lost chances of his little plan again and again because of his duty, even as a spectator felt unfair for him.  Fortunately, the heroine finally understood, and the love story ended well.

That was a love story supposed to be. In real life, however, it is hard that two people really understand each other. They don’t trust each other. They being together simply has a purpose. They take advantage of each other. When one become less advantage, the one is always dumped.

But I don’t think something wrong with that. I learned that lesson when I was young, when I thought love was supposed be like the ending in this movie. Now, I find out love is so complicated that you must have plenty of time to deal with it. And I don’t have any luxuries of that time.

Probably, when a guy found out that he was not interested in being in a relationship for the first time, he have grown up. He simply wants to invest everything he has into himself.
