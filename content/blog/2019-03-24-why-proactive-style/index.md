It's a little experience from my daily work.

Maybe, you can call it a sense of danger, when you are not get much work assigned. You can predict, however, what will be your next assignment in a short time has to be well prepared for some time. But your boss can not. They always think in their piece of mind that you are all prepared for what will be told.

It's a common situation in a team of software development where the boss is not as experienced as he/she could accurately estimate the time that you need for the job. For example, you may need time for the research for the techniques to the new requirements, the technical debt you must pay before writing the new business code.

If you cannot forsee the upcoming assignment and prepare it in advance, the only one suffers is you. You have to work overtime to fix the problems, even though the boss takes responsible for this too.
The only way to avoid a situation like this is to act proactively. That's my little experience from my recent work. And I quite believe that this is an important way to be productivity for a team, especially when you manage some people.

That was a real story happened recently in my work. And I was inspired from it, and choose this name for my new personal blog as _proactive.style_. I will write this story down in details if I have time.

Well, that's a barely explanation for my blog's name.

In this blog, I will focus on sharing my views on _Front-End Engineering_, _Buiding User Interfaces_, _Productivity_, addition to some stories of mine. Update weekly for now.
